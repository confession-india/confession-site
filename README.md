# Hi, I'm Sanjeev Raju | MSc Advanced Computer Science 🎓

I’ve recently moved back home after 6 years in England. [cite_start]I spent that time finishing my Master’s at **Hertfordshire University** [cite: 3] [cite_start]previously worked in **Milton Keynes** across Healthcare and Fintech. I've seen firsthand how massive datasets can actually help people when the tech is done properly.

### 🕊️ My Project: [Confess India](https://confessionindia.in)
**"Release the weight. You've carried it long enough."**

I started this because I noticed how heavy everything has been feeling lately. I wanted to build a bit of a "digital sanctuary"—a proper place for anyone, whether they're in a rainy UK suburb or right here in India, to offload their burdens without any judgment.

* **The Tech:** It’s properly sorted. Built on a serverless (Firebase) architecture that’s hardened and secure.
* **Privacy:** No tracking, no cookies, and no "Big Brother" sign-ups. Just absolute anonymity.
* **Impact:** It’s already live with over 150 organic voices from the global Indian diaspora.

### 🎓 MSc Research (The "Science" Bit)
**Peer-to-Peer Default Loan Prediction**
I dove deep into P2P lending data, analyzing nearly 200,000 records to predict loan defaults. I compared models like **Random Forest and SVM**, using **AUROC ratings** to find the most reliable ways for investors to make decisions without the guesswork.

### 🛠️ What I bring to the table
* [cite_start]**Healthcare Data:** Spent my time in the UK reducing hospital readmissions by 15%, saving £200,000 a year. [cite_start]I ensured everything stayed strictly **GDPR and NHS compliant**.
* [cite_start]**Fintech Risk:** I helped boost compliance from 85% to 99% to meet **RBI standards**  [cite_start]and dug through 100,000+ transactions to identify revenue-boosting trends.
* [cite_start]**The Stack:** I'm handy with **Power BI, Tableau, AWS (Sagemaker/S3), and Azure (Databricks)**.
